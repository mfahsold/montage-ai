# Run dev autoscale smoketests locally using `./scripts/ci/run-dev-smoke.sh` or on a controlled runner outside of GitHub Actions (Jenkins/Drone).
# If you need to reproduce the original behavior, run the script locally with the corresponding env vars:
# REGISTRY_URL=127.0.0.1:30500 IMAGE_NAME=montage-ai CLUSTER_NAMESPACE=montage-ai ./scripts/ci/run-dev-smoke.sh --tag "dev-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"

# The original workflow contents were removed. See `docs/ci.md` for local CI guidance.
