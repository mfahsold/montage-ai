Controlled runs (manual sampling):
- run 20260120_212444 -> finished (API observed) in 1.492s (worker log)
- run 20260120_212243 -> timed out (API polling window) — worker may have completed but API returned transient state

Worker log excerpts (scene detection + completion):
[worker] 🎬 [Job 20260120_211346] ✓ Scene Detection completed in 0.9s
[worker] 🎬 [Job 20260120_211346] ✓ Scene Detection completed in 0.9s
[worker] 🎬 [Job 20260120_211346] Starting: Metadata Extraction
[worker] Telemetry: Job 20260120_211346 completed (success=True, duration=1.9s)

[worker] 🎬 [Job 20260120_212444] ✓ Scene Detection completed in 0.5s
[worker] Telemetry: Job 20260120_212444 completed (success=True, duration=1.4s)

Notes:
- Analysis proxy and preview fast-path executed on the worker; scene detection is fast (sub-second) for the small benchmark clips.
- The dominant reliability issue is API/job-store visibility shortly after worker completion (best-effort job-store updates sometimes not visible within the benchmark's polling window).
