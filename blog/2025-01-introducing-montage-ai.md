# Montage AI: Why We Polish Instead of Generate

*Published: January 2025*

In a world obsessed with generating video from thin air, we asked a different question: **What about the video you already have?**

Every day, creators shoot terabytes of footage—travel vlogs, interviews, indie films, family memories. And every day, that footage sits on hard drives, waiting for the hours of tedious labor required to turn it into something watchable.

Enter **Montage AI**.

## The "Polish, Don't Generate" Philosophy

While tools like Sora and Runway are amazing at hallucinating pixels, they don't help you tell *your* story. They create new realities; we enhance yours.

Montage AI is a **source-available**, privacy-first AI editor that acts as your **Junior Assistant Editor**. It doesn't replace your creativity; it handles the grunt work.

### What it does:
1.  **Listens to the Music**: Our beat detection engine analyzes your soundtrack to find the perfect cut points.
2.  **Watches your Footage**: It identifies stable shots and action, discarding the shaky floor shots. (Smart face framing coming soon!)
3.  **Builds a Story**: Instead of random clips, it follows a narrative arc—intro, build-up, climax, and resolution.
4.  **Exports to Your NLE**: This is our killer feature. We don't lock you into a walled garden. Export an `.otio` or `.edl` file and finish your cut in DaVinci Resolve or Premiere Pro.

## Why Source Available?

Video editing is personal. Your footage is private. You shouldn't have to upload 50GB of raw 4K video to a cloud server just to get a rough cut.

Montage AI runs **locally**. It uses your GPU (or a private cloud instance if you choose) to process everything. No data mining, no subscription fees for basic features, no "credits" that run out.

## The Future of Editing is Hybrid

We believe the future isn't "AI does everything." It's **AI + Human**.
- AI finds the beat. You choose the vibe.
- AI syncs the clips. You fine-tune the emotion.
- AI fixes the color. You grade the look.

## Try it Today

Montage AI is available now on GitHub. It's early days, but the potential is massive.
