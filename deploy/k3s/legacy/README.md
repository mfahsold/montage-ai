# Legacy Manifests (Archived)

These manifests are retained for historical reference only and are **not**
the canonical deployment path.

Use instead:
- `deploy/k3s/overlays/cluster/` (canonical)
- `deploy/k3s/README.md` (deployment guide)

Notes:
- Legacy files may contain placeholders and are **not** kept in sync.
- Do not add new changes here unless you are explicitly restoring legacy flows.
