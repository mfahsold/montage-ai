# Montage AI: Business Proposition & Market Positioning

**For:** Creators, Studios, Investors, Enterprise Buyers  
**Updated:** January 5, 2026  
**TL;DR:** Open-source AI video editor for professionals who value **privacy**, **control**, and **professional handoff**.

---

## The Problem

**Traditional video editing workflow:**

```
Upload Footage (privacy risk)
    ↓ 
Cloud Processing ($12-55/mo per user)
    ↓
Locked Output (vendor lock-in)
    ↓
Finish in NLE (export → re-import → rework)
```

**Costs:** $144-660/year per user × team size  
**Time:** 2-3x editing time (rough cut → NLE → finish)  
**Risk:** Footage uploaded to corporate servers

---

## The Solution: Montage AI

```
Add Footage (local files)
    ↓
AI Processing (local, 3 minutes)
    ↓
Export OTIO/EDL (industry standard)
    ↓
Finish in DaVinci/Premiere (seamless)
```

**Cost:** Free (open source) or commercial license  
**Privacy:** 100% local processing  
**Integration:** Native OTIO/EDL export to professional NLEs

---

- ❌ Simpler UI (by design)

### vs. Adobe Premiere
- ✅ No Creative Cloud subscription
- ✅ Privacy by design

- ❌ Not a full NLE (intentional)

### vs. Frame
- ✅ Beat-sync editing
- ✅ OTIO/EDL export

---

## Business Model

### Current (Q1 2026)
- **Open Source (PolyForm NC):** Free for non-commercial use
- **Community:** GitHub, documentation, word-of-mouth
- **Enterprise Beta:** Early partnerships for on-prem deployments

### Projected Revenue Streams (2026-2027)

| Stream | Estimate | TAM | Note |
|--------|----------|-----|------|
| Enterprise License | $5-10k/year | Studios, agencies | 10-50 customers |
| Cloud Acceleration | $10-50/mo per user | Creators | 500-2k active |

## One-Page Pitch

**Montage AI** is the **free, open-source, privacy-first AI rough-cut tool** for creators and professionals.

We replace expensive cloud tools (Descript, Adobe, Opus Clip) with a local-first alternative that:
- Costs $0 (free OSS) or $5-10k/year (enterprise)
- Exports to DaVinci/Premiere (OTIO) — unique in market
- Handles vertical video natively (Shorts Studio 2.0)
- Leaves your data on your machine (compliance advantage)

**Market:** 1M+ creators + 100k studios seeking faster, cheaper, private workflows.  
**Business Model:** Freemium (OSS) → Enterprise licensing + Cloud acceleration + Support.  
**Year 1 Target:** $50-100k ARR, 5-10 enterprise customers, 5k active users.

**Ask:** $200k seed for team + marketing to establish market leadership.
