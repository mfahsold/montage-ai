# Montage AI: Business Proposition & Investor Brief

**TL;DR:** The open-source AI rough-cut tool trusted by professionals who value **privacy**, **control**, and **professional handoff**.

---

## The Problem

**Every video team faces this workflow:**

```
Upload (Privacy Risk)
    ↓ 
Cloud Processing ($$$ per month)
    ↓
Polished Output (Nice, but locked in)
    ↓
Finish in NLE (Export → Re-import → Rework)
```

**Costs:** $12-54/month per user × team size  
**Time:** 2-3x the editing time (rough cut → NLE → finish)  
**Risk:** Footage leaves your machine, data goes to corporate servers

---

## The Solution: Montage AI

```
Drop Clips
    ↓
AI Rough Cut (Local, 3 minutes)
    ↓
Export OTIO/EDL
    ↓
Finish in DaVinci/Premiere (10 minutes)
```

**Cost:** Free (OSS) or commercial license  
**Privacy:** 100% local processing  
**Integration:** Native to professional NLEs (OTIO standard)

## One-Page Pitch

**Montage AI** is the **free, open-source, privacy-first AI rough-cut tool** for creators and professionals.

We replace expensive cloud tools (Descript, Adobe, Opus Clip) with a local-first alternative that:
- Costs $0 (free OSS) or $5-10k/year (enterprise)
- Exports to DaVinci/Premiere (OTIO) — unique in market
- Handles vertical video natively (Shorts Studio 2.0)
- Leaves your data on your machine (compliance advantage)

**Market:** 1M+ creators + 100k studios seeking faster, cheaper, private workflows.  
**Business Model:** Freemium (OSS) → Enterprise licensing + Cloud acceleration + Support.  
**Year 1 Target:** $50-100k ARR, 5-10 enterprise customers, 5k active users.

**Ask:** $200k seed for team + marketing to establish market leadership.
