## Twitter/X Positioning

### Main Thread

🧵 Montage AI: The open-source rough-cut tool professional editors actually want.

We solve a real problem: Descript is $30/mo. Adobe Firefly is $54/mo. Neither exports OTIO for finishing in your NLE.

Montage AI is free, local-first, and gives you OTIO export.

Drop clips → AI rough cut (3m) → OTIO export → Finish in DaVinci (10m)

Privacy? 100% local. Cost? Free.

Why can't you use other tools?
- Descript: No OTIO export, cloud-only, $30/mo
- Adobe: $54/mo, Creative Cloud lock-in
- Opus Clip: Cloud-only, $30-100/mo, limited NLE integration

Montage is the alternative built for professionals who value control.

4 core features:
🎙️ Transcript Editor (Descript-style)
📱 Shorts Studio (vertical native)
🎚️ Quality Profiles (Preview → Master)
📤 OTIO Export (pro handoff)

Free and open-source. Try it:

We're hiring: Full-stack, ML, DevOps, Product.
Early-stage, mission-driven, equity available.

### Quick Takes (Individual Tweets)

**Take 1:**
Descript is great. $30/month though. And it doesn't export OTIO.

So we built Montage AI: Free rough cuts + OTIO export for DaVinci/Premiere.

Local processing. No data leaks. Open source.

github.com/mfahsold/montage-ai

**Take 2:**
The video editing market is broken:
- Cloud tools: $$$ + privacy risks
- Local NLEs: Powerful but slow for rough cuts
- AI tools: Great results but can't hand off to professionals

Montage AI bridges all three.

github.com/mfahsold/montage-ai

**Take 3:**
"We polish pixels. We don't generate them."

Montage AI is not a generative video tool. It's a post-production assistant that takes your footage and makes it production-ready in 3 minutes.

Then you hand it off to your NLE for finishing.

Works with DaVinci, Premiere, FCP.

github.com/mfahsold/montage-ai

**Take 4:**
Privacy wins:
- Descript: Uploads to cloud
- Adobe: Creative Cloud telemetry
- Montage AI: Everything local, open source, auditable

Pick your own cloud (optional) if you want GPU acceleration. Otherwise: your machine, your rules.

**Take 5:**
The Shorts format won't go away. Reels. TikToks. YouTube Shorts are permanent now.

Montage AI has Shorts Studio 2.0: Smart reframing, safe zones, caption styles.

Create vertical content in 1 click.

**Take 6:**
Montage AI is now hiring:
- Senior Full-Stack (React + Python)
- ML Engineer (Llama, audio models)
- DevOps (K3s, Helm)
- Product Manager

Mission: Make professional video editing fast and free.

Equity available. Remote-friendly.

DMs open.

**Take 7:**
Released: Production-grade job queue (RQ + Redis).
Next: Transcript Editor live, Shorts Studio 2.0, OTIO verified in DaVinci + Premiere.

Q1 2026 is massive for Montage AI. Follow along:
