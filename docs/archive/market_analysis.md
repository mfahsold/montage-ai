## Executive Summary

The video production landscape has bifurcated into "Generative AI" (creating from scratch) and "AI-Assisted Editing" (polishing existing footage). Montage AI strategically positions itself in the latter category, targeting the "Efficiency-Focused Creator" and "Marketing Video Lead".

## Key Market Signals

### 1. Quality is the Trust Metric
*   **Signal:** Video is now a mainstream marketing asset, but low-quality video damages brand trust.
*   **Implication:** We cannot just "make video fast"; we must make *good* video fast.
*   **Feature Response:** **Quality Profiles** (Standard/High/Master) and **Audio Polish** are not optional add-ons but core requirements [1].

### 2. Text-Based Editing is the New Standard
*   **Signal:** Market leaders like Descript and Adobe Premiere have normalized editing video by editing text.
*   **Implication:** A timeline-only interface is now considered "legacy" or "too hard" for our primary persona.
*   **Feature Response:** **Transcript Editor** must be a first-class citizen with word-level precision [2][3].

### 3. Short-Form Dominance
*   **Signal:** YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Reels are the primary growth engines for creators. YouTube explicitly defines Shorts as a distinct product with its own creation tools.
*   **Implication:** Vertical video is not just a crop; it's a format with its own grammar (fast cuts, captions, face tracking).
*   **Feature Response:** **Shorts Studio 2.0** with Smart-Reframe and native Caption Styles [5][6].

### 4. AI Reframe as a Differentiator
*   **Signal:** Tools like Opus Clip have set the bar for "repurposing" long-form content. The quality of the reframe (keeping the subject in focus smoothly) is the main competitive battleground.
*   **Implication:** Simple center-cropping is insufficient. We need "cinematic" reframing.
*   **Feature Response:** **Smart-Reframe v2** with subject tracking and motion smoothing [4].

### 5. The "Clean Audio" Expectation
*   **Signal:** Professional NLEs (DaVinci Resolve) now include one-click "Voice Isolation". Users expect this "magic button" to fix bad microphone audio.
*   **Implication:** We must offer a comparable "Clean Audio" toggle.
*   **Feature Response:** **Audio Polish** using source separation models [7].

### 6. Professional Handoff (The "Pro" Safety Net)
*   **Signal:** AI tools often hit a ceiling where manual control is needed. If users can't export to a pro tool, they abandon the AI tool.
*   **Implication:** We must provide an "eject button" to professional NLEs.
*   **Feature Response:** **OTIO Export** (OpenTimelineIO) as a standard deliverable [8].
