# Cluster Deployment (Internal)

This repository is public, so cluster-specific deployment runbooks are kept in
the private documentation set.

Public references:
- `deploy/k3s/README.md` for supported overlays and generic deployment flow.
- `docs/operations/preview-slo.md` for preview SLO verification guidance.

If you need the internal runbook, contact the maintainers.
