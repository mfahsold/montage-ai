# Cluster Deployment (Internal)

This repository is public, so cluster-specific deployment runbooks are kept in
the private documentation set.

Public references:
- `deploy/README.md` for the canonical deployment entry point.
- `deploy/k3s/README.md` for supported overlays and cluster deployment flow.
- `docs/operations/README.md` for public operational runbooks.

If you need the internal runbook, contact the maintainers.
