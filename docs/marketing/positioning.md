# Montage AI - Positioning & Messaging Strategy

> **Single Source of Truth** for all marketing, documentation, and public communications.
> If it contradicts this document, it is wrong.

## Core Identity

*   **Product Name**: Montage AI
*   **Tagline**: "We do not generate pixels; we polish them."
*   **Short Description**: The local-first AI assistant that turns raw footage into beat-synced montages.
*   **License Status**: **Source Available** (PolyForm Noncommercial).
    *   *Do NOT use:* "Open Source" (without qualification), "MIT", "Apache".
    *   *Do use:* "Source Available", "Free for Personal Use", "Open for Contribution".

## Key Value Propositions (The "Why")

1.  **Polish, Don't Generate**: We are the antidote to AI hallucinations. We respect the source footage.
2.  **Privacy First**: Your footage stays on your drive. No mandatory cloud upload.
3.  **NLE Interoperability**: We are not a walled garden. We export `.otio` and `.edl` to DaVinci Resolve/Premiere.
4.  **Hybrid Power**: Runs locally on consumer hardware, with optional cloud offloading (cgpu) for heavy tasks.

## Approved Claims (The "What")

| Feature | Status | Approved Claim |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beat Sync** | ✅ Live | "Automatically cuts to the beat of your music." |
| **Face Detection** | 🚧 Planned | "Smart framing focuses on people and action." (Mark as *Coming Soon* or *Beta*) |
| **Offline Mode** | ✅ Live | "Runs locally on your hardware." (Add "Optional cloud features available") |
| **Cost** | ⚠️ Variable | "Free for personal use." (Avoid specific $ amounts for cloud costs) |
| **AI Models** | ✅ Live | "Uses Whisper for transcription and LLMs for creative direction." |

## Forbidden / Dangerous Claims ⛔

*   ❌ "100% Offline" (False if using cgpu or remote LLM; say "Local-First")
*   ❌ "Open Source" (False strictly speaking; say "Source Available")
*   ❌ "Generates Video" (We edit, we don't generate)
*   ❌ "Real-time" (We are a batch processor)
*   ❌ Specific dollar costs (e.g., "$0.10 per hour") - Prices change, hardware varies.

## Tone of Voice

*   **Persona**: The "Junior Assistant Editor". Helpful, eager, handles the grunt work.
*   **Style**: Pragmatic, honest, technical but accessible.
*   **Audience**: Filmmakers, YouTubers, Developers. Not "AI Hype Beasts".
