# Montage AI - Social Media Strategy 2025

## Core Identity
**"The Source-Available AI Editor for Real Filmmakers."**
Not a toy. Not a generator. A tool for people who shoot video.

## Target Audience
1.  **The "Prosumer" YouTuber**: Has a Sony A7SIII but hates the first 2 hours of editing.
2.  **The Self-Hoster**: Loves Docker, NAS, and owning their data. Hates Adobe subscriptions.
3.  **The Developer/Creator**: Wants to hack their workflow (Python + Video).

## Channels & Tactics

### 1. GitHub (The Home Base)
*   **Goal**: Stars & Forks.
*   **Tactic**: High-quality README, "Good First Issues", responsive discussions.
