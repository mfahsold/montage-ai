- `docs/images/web-ui-dashboard.png`: The main dashboard showing the upload area and style selection.

## Getting Started

## Guidelines
- Use a consistent window size (e.g., 1280x800 or 1920x1080).
- Use a clean browser profile (no extensions visible).
- Ensure sensitive information is not visible.
- Compress images to keep the repository size small (use PNG or WebP).
